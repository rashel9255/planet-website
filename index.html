        <h3>What is Solar System</h3>
        <p>The Solar System is a collection of celestial bodies, including the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects that are bound by gravity. It is located in the Milky Way galaxy and is approximately 4.6 billion years old.</p>

        <h3>The Sun – The Heart of the Solar System</h3>
        <img src="images/Sun.jpg" alt="The Sun" width="400" height="300">
        <p>The Sun is a star at the center of our Solar System. It contains more than 99% of the total mass of the Solar System and provides the necessary light and heat to sustain life on Earth.</p>

        <h3>Planet of the Solar System</h3>
        <p> There are 8 planets in solar system . They are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars ,Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune</p>

        <h3>Mercury</h3>
        <img src="images/Mercury.jpg" alt="Mercury" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with a trace atmosphere. While it is the smallest and least massive planet of the Solar System, its surface gravity is slightly higher than that of Mars. The surface of Mercury is similar to Earth's Moon, heavily cratered, with expansive rues system, generated from thrust faults, and bright ray systems, formed by ejecta.</p>

        <h3>Venus</h3>
        <img src="images/Venus.jpg" alt="Venus" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is often called Earth's "twin" or "sister" among the planets of the Solar System for its orbit being the closest to Earth's, both being rocky planets and having the most similar and nearly equal size and mass. Venus, though, differs significantly by having no liquid water, and its atmosphere is far thicker and denser than that of any other rocky body in the Solar System. It is composed of mostly carbon dioxide and has a cloud layer of sulfuric acid that spans the whole planet. At the mean surface level, the atmosphere reaches a temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level</p>

        <h3>Earth</h3>
        <img src="images/earth-image.jpg" alt="Earth" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. The planet's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions, leading to the proliferation of aerobic organisms and the formation of an ozone layer that protects the biosphere from harmful solar radiation.</p>

        <h3>Mars</h3>
        <img src="images/mars.png" alt="Mars" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. It is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. The planet has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and a canyon system, Vales Mariners, that dwarfs the Grand Canyon.</p>

        <h3>Jupiter</h3>
        <img src="images/jupiter.png" alt="Jupiter" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and is known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for hundreds of years. The planet has at least 79 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System.</p>

        <h3>Saturn</h3>
        <img src="images/Saturn.jpg" alt="Saturn" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is best known for its stunning ring system. It is a gas giant with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has at least 83 moons, with Titan being the largest, which has a dense atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Uranus</h3>
        <img src="images/Uranus.png" alt="Uranus" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is unique for its tilted axis, which causes extreme seasonal variations. It is an ice giant with a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a blue color. Uranus has 27 known moons and a faint ring system.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Neptune</h3>
        <img src="images/Neptune.png" alt="Neptune" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is an ice giant with a deep blue color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Neptune has strong winds and storms, including the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The planet has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest, which orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction.</p>
